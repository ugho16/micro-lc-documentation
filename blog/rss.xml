            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Micro-frontends are very powerful, but you need to orchestrate them to provide a consistent experience. This is exactly the reason why we at <a href="https://mia-platform.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mia-Platform</a> developed <span class="micro_j8I5">micro</span><span class="lc_Z5FW">-lc</span> and released it as open-source.<br>
<!-- -->If you are not familiar with it, in a nutshell, <strong><span class="micro_j8I5">micro</span><span class="lc_Z5FW">-lc</span> is an open-source micro-frontends orchestrator</strong>: you can find further information in the <a href="/docs">documentation introduction</a>, or you can read this <a href="https://blog.mia-platform.eu/en/micro-lc-the-new-open-source-micro-fronted-orchestrator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> to get a more discursive overview.</p><p>We are proud to announce <span class="micro_j8I5">micro</span><span class="lc_Z5FW">-lc</span> <strong>v2.0</strong>! A lot of new features have been implemented and optimized, making the tool more powerful than ever. Micro-frontends keep evolving, and so does <span class="micro_j8I5">micro</span><span class="lc_Z5FW">-lc</span>.</p><p>Let's take a closer look to what has changed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_VUnx" id="a-new-live-playground">A new live playground<a class="hash-link" href="#a-new-live-playground" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>One of the main news is the <strong>new <a href="/playground/">playground</a> available on the website</strong>. Here you can try <span class="micro_j8I5">micro</span><span class="lc_Z5FW">-lc</span> live, without the need to install anything: in the box on the right you will directly see the result. You are free to do all the experiments you like and test the full potential of <span class="micro_j8I5">micro</span><span class="lc_Z5FW">-lc</span>.</p><p>What are you waiting for? Unleash your creativity!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_VUnx" id="-has-never-been-lighter"><span class="micro_j8I5">micro</span><span class="lc_Z5FW">-lc</span> has never been lighter<a class="hash-link" href="#-has-never-been-lighter" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>If you are familiar with <span class="micro_j8I5">micro</span><span class="lc_Z5FW">-lc</span> and you have already used it, you will love this new feature. If you are a new user, you will love it too, don't worry.</p><p><span class="micro_j8I5">micro</span><span class="lc_Z5FW">-lc</span> can now be used <strong>through a <a href="/docs/getting-started#import-from-cdn">CDN</a></strong>: this means that the download will be much lighter and the interface will be easier. This because <span class="micro_j8I5">micro</span><span class="lc_Z5FW">-lc</span> and <code>microlc-element-composer</code> (which used to be a separated core plugin) are now tightened together.<br>
<!-- -->The bundle size is very low and so pages load faster, ensuring higher performances to your micro-frontends.</p><p>In addition, the code that makes <span class="micro_j8I5">micro</span><span class="lc_Z5FW">-lc</span> run is available as a standalone library that you can download via <code>npm</code>. Just run the following command:</p><div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_whmj theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_eHmu"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_NGoy thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_Tm5V"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token function" style="color:#d73a49">npm</span><span class="token plain"> i @micro-lc/orchestrator</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_gMXq"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_C5fQ" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_bxJP" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_uCIU" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_VUnx" id="new-yaml-integration">New YAML integration<a class="hash-link" href="#new-yaml-integration" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Besides the already supported JSON, we introduced the possibility to <strong>write <a href="/api/micro-lc-web-component#configuration">configuration</a> in YAML</strong>. Since YAML syntax is far more easily understandable for humans, this feature will boost you building your micro-frontends.</p><p>But, if you are a JSON lover, you can continue to use it as you have been doing until now. You can also use the converter available in the <a href="/playground/">Playground section</a> to easily convert your YAML to JSON, and viceversa.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_VUnx" id="-and-a-lot-of-other-cool-stuff">... and a lot of other cool stuff<a class="hash-link" href="#-and-a-lot-of-other-cool-stuff" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Besides all the above, other new features and improvements have been added:</p><ul><li>New <a href="/docs/concepts/communication">communication</a> method between applications;</li><li><span class="micro_j8I5">micro</span><span class="lc_Z5FW">-lc</span> now supports centralized states from plugin;</li><li><span class="micro_j8I5">micro</span><span class="lc_Z5FW">-lc</span> is embeddable everywhere, so you can use it without downloading it;</li><li>You can have custom <a href="/docs/guides/layout">layouts</a> by default.</li><li>The documentation has been updated and fully restyled!</li></ul><p>That's it for now, but we will keep updating and improving <span class="micro_j8I5">micro</span><span class="lc_Z5FW">-lc</span>.</p><p>If you want to <strong>contribute</strong> to the project, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/micro-lc/micro-lc/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open issues</a>, and feel free to open a new one if you don't find what you are looking for.<br>
<!-- -->Moreover, the <a href="/blog">blog section</a> has been introduced on the website, so consider writing a post for sharing your experience building awesome micro-frontends!</p>]]></content:encoded>
