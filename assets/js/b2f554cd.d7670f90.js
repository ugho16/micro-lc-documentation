This is exactly the reason why we at [Mia-Platform](https://mia-platform.eu/) developed <micro-lc></micro-lc> and released it as open-source.  \\nIf you are not familiar with it, in a nutshell, **<micro-lc></micro-lc> is an open-source micro-frontends orchestrator**: you can find further information in the [documentation introduction](/docs), or you can read this [blog post](https://blog.mia-platform.eu/en/micro-lc-the-new-open-source-micro-fronted-orchestrator) to get a more discursive overview.\\n\\nWe are proud to announce <micro-lc></micro-lc> **v2.0**! A lot of new features have been implemented and optimized, making the tool more powerful than ever. Micro-frontends keep evolving, and so does <micro-lc></micro-lc>.\\n\\nLet\'s take a closer look to what has changed.\\n\\n## A new live playground\\n\\nOne of the main news is the **new [playground](/playground/) available on the website**. Here you can try <micro-lc></micro-lc> live, without the need to install anything: in the box on the right you will directly see the result. You are free to do all the experiments you like and test the full potential of <micro-lc></micro-lc>.\\n\\nWhat are you waiting for? Unleash your creativity!\\n\\n## <micro-lc></micro-lc> has never been lighter\\n\\nIf you are familiar with <micro-lc></micro-lc> and you have already used it, you will love this new feature. If you are a new user, you will love it too, don\'t worry.\\n\\n<micro-lc></micro-lc> can now be used **through a [CDN](/docs/getting-started#import-from-cdn)**: this means that the download will be much lighter and the interface will be easier. This because <micro-lc></micro-lc> and `microlc-element-composer` (which used to be a separated core plugin) are now tightened together.  \\nThe bundle size is very low and so pages load faster, ensuring higher performances to your micro-frontends.\\n\\nIn addition, the code that makes <micro-lc></micro-lc> run is available as a standalone library that you can download via `npm`. Just run the following command:\\n\\n```shell\\nnpm i @micro-lc/orchestrator\\n```\\n\\n## New YAML integration\\n\\nBesides the already supported JSON, we introduced the possibility to **write [configuration](/api/micro-lc-web-component#configuration) in YAML**. Since YAML syntax is far more easily understandable for humans, this feature will boost you building your micro-frontends.\\n\\nBut, if you are a JSON lover, you can continue to use it as you have been doing until now. You can also use the converter available in the [Playground section](/playground/) to easily convert your YAML to JSON, and viceversa.\\n\\n## ... and a lot of other cool stuff\\n\\nBesides all the above, other new features and improvements have been added:\\n\\n- New [communication](/docs/concepts/communication) method between applications;\\n- <micro-lc></micro-lc> now supports centralized states from plugin;\\n- <micro-lc></micro-lc> is embeddable everywhere, so you can use it without downloading it;\\n- You can have custom [layouts](/docs/guides/layout) by default.\\n- The documentation has been updated and fully restyled!\\n\\nThat\'s it for now, but we will keep updating and improving <micro-lc></micro-lc>.\\n\\nIf you want to **contribute** to the project, take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/micro-lc/micro-lc/issues), and feel free to open a new one if you don\'t find what you are looking for.  \\nMoreover, the [blog section](/blog) has been introduced on the website, so consider writing a post for sharing your experience building awesome micro-frontends!"}]}')}}]);
